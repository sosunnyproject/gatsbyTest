    <p>Once upon a time there was a sassy girl who loved gallery hoppings, . 
    Walking through mountains of <em>life decisions</em>, valleys of <em>crisis</em>, and rivers of <em>changes</em>,
    she found some gems in the land of software engineering. 
    But at the same time, she knew her path started with her love of theatre and arts. 
    Then she started combining media and technology through VR and AR. 
    Now she is exploring the endless world of creative coding.
